# AndroidSee
AndroidSee - an automatic tool for debugging presentation failures in android applications <br>
This is basically a phd student's work--WebSee from Sonal, USC.<br>
We modified it to test visible element in android app and build the R-tree based on the xml generated by uiautomator from google<br><br>

In order to use this applications, you have to install the open-cv library first. We use to different screenshot from android app as input. Output the localization of faulty visual element.<br>

Feel free to contact me if you have some problem when using this tool.
